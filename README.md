# Project Overview:

Welcome to SalesWebMVC, an immersive course project that guides you through the development of a robust web application using ASP.NET Core 6, C#, and Entity Framework Core. This project focuses on MVC architecture and leverages SQL Server as the database. Dive into the world of web development by mastering CRUD operations, incorporating advanced search functionality, and building a solid back-end for a simulated sales application.

## Project Features:

**ASP.NET Core 6 MVC Architecture:**

Explore the power and flexibility of ASP.NET Core 6 as you delve into the MVC architecture. Gain insights into creating modular, maintainable, and scalable web applications.

**Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with SQL Server:**
SalesWebMVC utilizes Entity Framework Core as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), with SQL Server as the database. Learn how to model and manipulate your database seamlessly.

**CRUD Operations:**

Master the fundamentals of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. SalesWebMVC provides a hands-on experience for understanding how to manage data effectively in a sales scenario.

**Search Functionality:**

Dive into advanced features with search functionality, allowing users to filter and find sales based on sellers, dates, types, and other relevant criteria. Learn to implement efficient and user-friendly search capabilities.

**Basic UI with a Focus on Back-End:**

While the UI is intentionally kept basic, the emphasis is on building a robust back-end to simulate a functional sales application. Understand the importance of separating concerns and optimizing the application's performance.

## How to Use:
**Clone the Repository:**

**"git clone https://github.com/your-username/saleswebmvc.git"**

### Create Database on SQL Server:

**"CREATE DATABASE SalesWebMVC;"**

### **Run Database Migrations:**
